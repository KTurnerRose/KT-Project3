# KT-Project3
Project Description
This program simulates a makeup distribution service, and provides functionality at the client level.
The user can log in or make an account with the service.  The list of products available is provided to the user, who can then add items to their cart.  
The user can also see what items they have in their cart.


Requirements
• You may work individually or with a partner of your choosing.
• You may reuse code from previous project(s), if appropriate.
• All of your programming files should be in a private GitHub repository in your section’s organization.
- The repository must be named with your initials + dash + Project3 (e.g. LD-JH-Project3).
- The repository should have a .gitignore file and a README file.
• You will need to have at least four classes, each of which satisfy exactly one of these requirements:
- A parent class that may or may not be abstract;
- A child class that inherits from the parent class;
- An unrelated class (that does not inherit from the parent or child classes); and
- A component class, an object of which can be included as a field in any of the other three classes.
• Think about what each of the classes will represent. What added or modified methods will the child
class have? What added fields will the child class have? Where does the component belong? How
will the unrelated class interact with the others?
• Your classes should be declared in header file(s) (with comments) and defined in corresponding .cpp
file(s).
• To make sure your classes are working the way you designed, include a testing.cpp file that has a
main function and tests all of your non-trivial methods thoroughly.
- Put an add_executable line in CMakeLists.txt to create an executable for your testing program.
• Use your classes to have a fully-functioning program in main.cpp. The program should be interactive.
The more effort you put in, the more you will impress the graders and get a good grade.
- Put an add_executable line in CMakeLists.txt to create an executable for your main program.
• Write about your program in your README file. Justify the choices you made in creating the project
(which should include answers to the questions above).
• All of the above must be committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
• On Gradescope, submit the URL of the last commit in a submission.txt file.
